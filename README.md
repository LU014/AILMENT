<b>Title:</b> EMC_CanML

<b>Project Description:</b> Mahcine learning framework incoporates integrative feature importance analysis for prediction and analysis of microbial involvement in colorectal caner.

---------------------

<b>Current stage:</b> Framework had been built. Predictive and identification performance was evaluated.

<b>Prospects:</b> 1. Incoporate explainable AI such as SHAP analysis for diagnosis or other binary classification problems in cancer microbiome; 2. Leverage more ML models or advanced ML models to the framework; 3. More data to be fed into the framework would be appreciating for more accurate microbial involvement identification for CRC.

<b>Tip:</b> Currently, we only have data from published paper or other cohort. Our own data is still generating in the lab.
